Flix Programming Language","keywords":"","body":"The Flix Programming Language\nWelcome to the official website for the documentation of the Flix programming language.\nNB: Flix is still under major development and the language is expected to change.\nFlix is a functional and \nlogic programming language for \nfixpoint computations on \nlattices.\nFlix is heavily inspired by the Datalog language,\nbut extends its expressive power by adding support for user-defined lattices and operations on them.\nThe primary use case of Flix is for development and implementation of scalable \nstatic analysis tools,\nespecially points-to analysis and \ndataflow analysis.\nAs a special case, Flix can be used as a general-purpose Datalog solver with the benefits of\na type system plus an integrated profiler and debugger.\nUnlike general-purpose languages such as\nC++ and Java, Flix is a special-purpose (domain-specific)\nprogramming language. Flix is intended for (recursive) constraints on relations and lattices. In other words,\nyou cannot write a web server or a video game in Flix.\nA Flix program is a set of facts and a set of constraints (rules) for deriving new facts. \nThe computation of a Flix programs determines all possible facts that can be derived from the initial facts\nand the constraints.\n"},"ch01-00-getting-started.html":{"url":"ch01-00-getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\n\nInstall Flix\nRun java -jar flix.jar --tutorial introduction > introduction.flix to generate a fresh tutorial file.\nOpen introduction.flix in your favorite editor or IDE and follow the instructions.\nRun the tutorial with java -jar flix.jar introduction.flix.\n\n"},"ch01-01-installation.html":{"url":"ch01-01-installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nFlix comes packaged as a single JAR that is executable on any platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X) that supports\nthe Java Runtime Environment.

The program language\n// we consider is very simple, it has three types of statements:\n//\n//      x = c        [assignment statement]\n//      x = y + z    [addition statement]\n//      x = y / z    [division statement]\n//\n//\n// We begin by defining a namespace for all our declarations. We could have\n// used the root namespace, but to avoid clashes with other examples we\n// create a new namespace.\n//\n\n//\n// We will represent the program-under-analysis using three input\n// relations. One for each type of statement:\n//\nrel LitStm(r: Str, c: Int)         // r = c\nrel AddStm(r: Str, x: Str, y: Str) // r = x + y\nrel DivStm(r: Str, x: Str, y: Str) // r = x / y\n\n//\n// The next step is to define the lattice LocalVar which maps every local\n// variable to an element of the constant propagation lattice (which we\n// define below.)\n//\n// We can think of this lattice the result of the analysis.\n//\nlat LocalVar(k: Str, v: Constant)\n\n//\n// To define the constant propagation lattice, we begin by defining the\n// type of constants. We define an enum with three variants: bottom and\n// top elements, and a constructor Cst(i) for any integer i.\n//\nenum Constant {\n      case Top,\n\n    case Cst(Int),\n\n      case Bot\n}\n\n//\n// The next task is to define the partial order on Constant.\n// This is straightforward with pattern matching on the arguments:\n//\ndef leq(e1: Constant, e2: Constant): Bool = match (e1, e2) with {\n    case (Bot, _)           => true\n    case (Cst(n1), Cst(n2)) => n1 == n2\n    case (_, Top)           => true\n    case _                  => false\n}\n\n//\n// Then its on to the least upper bound:\n//\ndef lub(e1: Constant, e2: Constant): Constant = match (e1, e2) with {\n    case (Bot, x)           => x\n    case (x, Bot)           => x\n    case (Cst(n1), Cst(n2)) => if (n1 == n2) e1 else Top\n    case _                  => Top\n}\n\n//\n// ... and the greatest lower bound:\n//\ndef glb(e1: Constant, e2: Constant): Constant = match (e1, e2) with {\n    case (Top, x)           => x\n    case (x, Top)           => x\n    case (Cst(n1), Cst(n2)) => if (n1 == n2) e1 else Bot\n    case _                  => Bot\n}\n\n//\n// This complete the specification of the lattice. We associate the\n// lattice components with the Constant type in the following way:\n//\nlet Constant<> = (Bot, Top, leq, lub, glb)\n// NB: In the future, this syntax is subject to change.\n\n//\n// Finally it is handy to have a small function to lift an integer into\n// an element of the constant propagation lattice. Strictly speaking,\n// this is not necessary.\n//\ndef alpha(i: Int): Constant = Cst(i)\n\n//\n// We can now define the semantic rules of the analysis.\n//\n\n//\n// The first rule models literal statements r = c and lifts the constant\n// into the constant propagation lattice. Intuitively, if the body of\n// the rule (whatever is to the right of ':-') then the head (what is on\n// the left of ':-') is inferred.\n//\nLocalVar(r, alpha(c)) :- LitStm(r, c).\n\n//\n// The second rule is more interesting. This says that if we have an\n// addition statement r = x + y, and the value of x is v1 and of y is v2\n// then the value of r is at least the value of the sum of v1 and v2.\n//\n// Here sum is a reference to a transfer function implemented below.\n//\nLocalVar(r, sum(v1, v2)) :- AddStm(r, x, y),\n                            LocalVar(x, v1),\n                            LocalVar(y, v2).\n\n//\n// The third rule is similar, but for division:\n//\nLocalVar(r, div(v1, v2)) :- DivStm(r, x, y),\n                            LocalVar(x, v1),\n                            LocalVar(y, v2).\n\n//\n// We must define the sum transfer function:\n//\ndef sum(e1: Constant, e2: Constant): Constant = match (e1, e2) with {\n    case (Bot, _)           => Bot\n    case (_, Bot)           => Bot\n    case (Cst(n1), Cst(n2)) => Cst(n1 + n2)\n    case _                  => Top\n}\n\n//\n// And the div transfer function:\n//\ndef div(e1: Constant, e2: Constant): Constant = match (e1, e2) with {\n    case (_, Bot)           => Bot\n    case (Bot, _)           => Bot\n    case (Cst(n1), Cst(n2)) => if (n2 == 0) Bot else Cst(n1 / n2)\n    case _                  => Top\n}\n\n// !! Notice the special case to avoid division-by-zero in the analysis itself !!\n\n//\n// This complete the analysis itself. But before we try to run it, let us\n// add some features to look for a simple type of bugs: Possible division-\n// by-zero errors.\n//\n\n//\n// We define a relation to hold the names of local variables possibly\n// involved in a division-by-zero error:\n//\nrel ArithmeticError(r: Str)\n\n//\n// We populate this relation with the rule below. This rule states that if\n// there is a division statement r = n / d, the value of the local variable\n// d is y, and y is possibly zero according to the `isMaybeZero` filter\n// function then we infer a possible error for `r`.\n//\nArithmeticError(r) :- isMaybeZero(y),\n                      DivStm(r, n, d),\n                      LocalVar(d, y).\n\n//\n// Defining the filter function is straightforward:\n//\ndef isMaybeZero(e: Constant): Bool = match e with {\n    case Bot    => false\n    case Cst(n) => n == 0\n    case Top    => true\n}\n\n//\n// Let us now try to analyse the following small program:\n//\n// x = 3;\n// y = 7;\n// z = 0;\n// w = x + y;\n// v = w / z;\n\n//\n// We encode this program using the input facts:\n//\nLitStm(\"x\", 3).        // x = 3\nLitStm(\"y\", 7).        // y = 7\nLitStm(\"z\", 0).        // z = 0\nAddStm(\"w\", \"x\", \"y\"). // w = x + y\nDivStm(\"v\", \"w\", \"z\"). // v = w / z\n\n//\n// We can now run our program with Flix and inspect the output!\n//\n// Run: flix --print LocalVar,ArithmeticError tutorial.flix\n//\n// This should produce output like:\n//\n\n// LocalVar:\n//\n//    +---+---------+\n//    | k | v       |\n//    +---+---------+\n//    | x | Cst(3)  |\n//    | y | Cst(7)  |\n//    | z | Cst(0)  |\n//    | w | Cst(10) |\n//    +---+---------+\n\n// ArithmeticError\n//\n//    +---+\n//    | r |\n//    +---+\n//    | v |\n//    +---+\n\n//\n// Here are some exercises for learning Flix:\n//\n// (0) Write some input programs and run the analysis on them.\n// (1) Extend the analysis with a variable assignment statement: x = y.\n// (2) Extend the analysis with operators for subtraction and multiplication.\n// (3) Modify the (constant propagation) lattice to have two extra elements Neg and

In every later stage of the compiler, every AST node is associated\n with a SourceLocation.\n\nCaveats\nThe grammar is pretty straightforward, but there are a couple of things to be aware of:\n\nCompilation of the parser class is slow due to the use of macros in Parboiled. \nThe error messages produced by Parboiled, if there is an error in the grammar, are almost unusable.\nThe PEG grammar is greedy. Make sure you understand what this means.\nThe AST is constructed during parsing. However, you should avoid any costly work during AST construction since an AST\nfragment may be constructed only to be discarded later because of a parse mismatch.  \nWhitespace must be handled carefully: \nThe production rule WS requires some whitespace, whereas \nThe production rule optWS allows whitespace.\n\n\nOptional semicolons are matched by the optSC rule.\nSource locations are tracked by pushing a SourcePosition on the stack when a syntactic element begins and again\nwhen the element ends.
